# :earth_americas: Hello World!

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a third-year student at the University of Michigan, pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science with a minor in Physics. I'm a passionate creator who loves learning new technologies and languages. I especially pride myself on writing clean and maintainable code that relies on test driven development. 


My experience is primarily in web development using the LAMP stack, but I've also built projects using C, C++, python, AngularJS, Go, and dart using the Flutter framework. Besides programming I spend a lot of time listening to music, reading, enjoying art, and writing.
